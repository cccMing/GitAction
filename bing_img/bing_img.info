The year was split into just two seasons back then—summer and winter—which explains why Sumardagurinn Fyrsti, the First Day of Summer, falls in chilly April. Indeed, folklore has it that if you put a dish of water outside the night before the holiday and it freezes, you'll have a good summer.

Hopefully we appreciate the dedication and wisdom of our teachers year-round, but this special day is certainly a timely reminder. For the last two years educators have battled the staggering challenges of the COVID pandemic; rallying their students, whether online or distanced and masked in the classroom; and doing their best to give children a safe, nurturing environment for learning. Their commitment has helped build a strong foundation for young people's future well-being and happiness, and it taught the value of community and resilience.","date":"May 3, 2022","bsTitle":"This lesson is going swimmingly","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220503_DuckHen%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1b8a8ed36c467dfa43928cd81179da97","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.

The bluebell is known by many names but those who know it as the 'fairy flower' might be the most prepared to withstand its strong, sweetly scented allure. According to British folklore, a blooming bluebell carpet on the woodland floor is a mystical place where fairies live. The legends hold that fairies hang their spells on the flowers to dry, and disturbing them would unleash the magic. In earlier times, children were warned that picking bluebells would cause them to be spirited away. Even adults could fall victim to the flower, being doomed to wander the woods and never escape. And heaven forbid you ever happen to hear the fairies ring the bluebells for their gatherings—it means your death is imminent, a belief that inspired another name for bluebells: 'dead men's bells.'","date":"May 6, 2022","bsTitle":"Dare to tread through the fairy flowers?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220506_HertfordshireBluebells%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"759506ce4ec434a39dc6f4736595de7e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.

These and similar rock formations are known by many names—hoodoos, tent rocks, earth pyramids, as well as fairy chimneys—and are typically found in dry, hot areas. Here in Cappadocia, in south-central Turkey, they were formed when a thick layer of volcanic ash solidified over millions of years into soft, porous rock called tuff that was overlaid by hard basalt. Cracks in the basalt allowed wind and rain to gradually wash away the softer bottom layer, leaving the hard basalt to cap tall columns of the tuff. The result is these unusual, often beautiful—and perhaps puzzling—formations that spread across the Anatolian plain.","date":"May 9, 2022","bsTitle":"Living rock","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220509_GoremeNationalPark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fd1821255a658a49906d6cb7536b753e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
